## **Project Description**
Flipped is a schedule management application that combines a calendar, to-do list, and filpped pomodoro timer. It is designed to help users efficiently manage their schedules while improving their mobile phone usage habits.

In modern society, mobile devices are essential tools, but excessive phone usage can disrupt productivity and daily routines.

By promoting self-discipline and mindful phone usage, the app helps users maintain better time management and healthier digital habits.
